Project Overview  
  
This project seeks to design an intelligent data collection agent that leverages APIs dealing  
with economic and stock data. In this project, 2 APIs are used (in accordance with the DMP)  
those are the FRED API from the Federal Reserve, as well as the Alpha Vantage API.  
  
The config file houses user-defined information that is crucial to the agent's functionality.
